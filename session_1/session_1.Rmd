Learning by doing
==================================
* Coding is not as difficult as people think
* My approach to teaching people to code is to force them to type (and click on) things they don't fully understand
* If they are curious enough, they will then ask "Hmm...why did that work?"
* Usually I have an answer ready (but if I don't, then their question becomes mine and I start Googling...)

Doing before understanding
===========================
* You will now
    + Set up a local workspace
    + Configure your source control software
    + Create an online repository for your work
    + Set up your local project files
    + Track them using version control
    + Push your changes to the online repository
    + Et cetera
* Later, I will explain what all this means

Setup your local working directory
==================================
*Do this once for each computer you work on*

* Create a top-level directory where all of your code will go
* Each project will have in its own directory underneath this one
* I call mine `git_workspace` -- I will use this name as a placeholder throughout these slides

Tell git who you are
==================================
* Start a new **terminal** (OS X) or **bash** (Linux) or **git-bash** (Windows) session
* Execute the following commands, substituting your information
* **Note:** Use the email address associated with your **GitHub** account

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE, highlight=TRUE}
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
```

* OS X users might need to issue the following commands as well

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE, highlight=TRUE}
git credential-osxkeychain
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

Configure RStudio
=================================
*	Open **RStudio**
*	Select the menu item **Tools > Global Options...**
* Click on the **Git/SVN** button
* Check the box that enables version control
* Quit **RStudio**

</div>

Create a new repository on GitHub
==================================
*Do this once for each project you work on*

* Log into **GitHub** (https://github.com)
* Click on **New repository** 
* Enter the name `session_1` and click **Create repository**

***
<div class='center'>
![](github_new_repo.png)
</div>

Get the URL for your new repository
=====================================
* Click on the **HTTPS** button under **Quick Setup** and copy the URL to your computer's clipboard
* I use `https://github.com/jasonmtroos/session_1.git` in subsequent examples
* **Note:** Your repository is *empty* in the sense that you have not added any files to it yet

***
<div class='center'>
![](repository_uri.png)
</div>



Create a new RStudio project
=================================
* Open **RStudio**
* Select **File > New Project...**
* Click on **Version Control** and then on **Git**
* Paste the URL you copied from Github into the **Repository URL** field
* Hit tab, then ensure **Project directory name** is set to `session_1`
* Under **Create project as subdirectory of:** click **Browse...** and then navigate to your `git_workspace` directory

***

</div>

Create a new R Markdown file
================================
* You do this one or more times for each project you work on
* Select **File > New File > R Markdown...**
* Set the **Title** to `My First Markdown`
* Enter your name as the **Author** and click **OK**

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_new_markdown.png)
</div>

Save your new R Markdown file
===============================
* Select **File > Save**
* Name the file `my_first_markdown.Rmd` and make sure it gets saved into `git_workspace/session_1` (this should be the default)

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_after_new_markdown.png)
</div>

Tell git to keep track of your new file(s)
===========================================
* Click on the **Git** tab in the upper right panel
* Check each of the boxes next to the three files listed
* Click on the **Commit** button
* In the window that pops up, type `Initial add` in the **Commit message** window

***
<div class='center'>
![](RStudio_git_commit.png)
</div>

Commit your changes
==========================
* Click **Commit**
* **RStudio** will now interact with **git** behind the scenes
* When they are done, **RStudio** will open a small window showing what **git** had to say

```
[master (root-commit) 2757d93] Initial add
 3 files changed, 47 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 my_first_markdown.Rmd
 create mode 100644 session_1.Rproj
```

Push your changes to GitHub
==============================

* Click on the **Push** button in the top right corner
* If you receive the following error...

```
error: unable to read askpass response from 'rpostback-askpass'
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Device not configured
```

* ...click on the **Gear icon > Shell...** and type

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
git push
```

* ...then enter your **GitHub username** and **password** when prompted

```
To https://github.com/jasonmtroos/session_1
   f5d8fc0..dbea7bb  master -> master
```

Compile your R Markdown file
===============================
* Click on the **Knit** button
* Your file will be used to generate a new HTML document, which will be displayed in a special document viewer window

Make a change to your R Markdown file
=======================================

* Change the boilerplate text in the R Markdown file you just created by inserting `This is my first markdown file.` above `## R Markdown`

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
cat( '```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nThis is my first markdown file.\n\n## R Markdown\n\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown...\n')
```
* Save your changes by selecting **File > Save**
* Click on **Knit** again to see how your file has changed

Commit your changes and push them to GitHub
=========================================
*Do this whenever you make changes to your file you want to keep*

* Click on the **Git** tab
* Check the box next to `my_first_markdown.Rmd` (ignore the file ending in `.html` for now)
* Click on **Commit**
* Enter the commit message `Added line to introduction`
* Click on **Commit** (*NB: not the same button as in the previous step*)
* Click on **Push**
* Close the dialog showing the output from **git**

View your file's history
========================
*Do this when trying to figure out where and when you introduced a mistake into your file*

* Highlight `my_first_markdown.Rmd` and then click on the **History** button
* You will see a summary of all versions of this file that you have previously committed to your local **git** repository

***

View your remote repository
===========================

* Go to (https://github.com/jasonmtroos/session_1) substituting your **GitHub username** for mine
* Here you will see the current state of your repository after your last **Push**
* If you click on `my_first_markdown.Rmd` and then the **History** button you will see a similar summary to the one provided by **RStudio**


What you've done so far
=======================
1. Set up your workspace
2. Created a git repository on GitHub and cloned it into your local workspace
3. Created an RStudio project and added an R Markdown file to it
4. Compiled your R Markdown file into an HTML document
5. Committed your edits to git and pushed them to GitHub
6. Viewed your commit history

What's next
===========
* Edit your R Markdown file so that it does something useful
* Get used to keeping track of files using git
* Understand how git, R, RStudio, and R Markdown can help you become a more organized and efficient researcher
